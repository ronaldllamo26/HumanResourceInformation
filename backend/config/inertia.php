| Why this file is published at all
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Only for `page_paths`. The package default is `resource_path('js/Pages')`,
| which resolves inside this folder — and since the backend/frontend split the
| page components are one level up in `frontend/resources/js/Pages`, so the
| default pointed at a directory that does not exist.
|
| Nothing fails at request time from this: `ensure_pages_exist` is false
| outside tests, so pages render regardless. What breaks is `assertInertia`,
| which checks the component is really on disk — it failed 37 tests with
| "Inertia page component file does not exist", which is the assertion doing
| exactly its job. That check is worth keeping rather than switching off: it
| is what catches a renamed or misspelled page, and CLAUDE.md records a real
| case of a page shipping unbuilt.
|
| Everything else below is the package's own default, copied verbatim.
